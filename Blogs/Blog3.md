Hi! For this blog, I want to discuss Docker, its uses, a practical example, and some other hypotheticals. It's really easy to get too technical with Docker,

* A bit on virtualization
* Docker vs. virtual machines
* Uses of Docker
* Dockerfile example
* Hypotheticals
* TravisCI with Docker 

Without further ado, let's get into it.

#### Virtualization 

Ever seen the acronym VM and not known what it stands for? Most likely, it stands for virtual machine, which uses a hypervisor (pretty much installed
