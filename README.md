## Just a lowly CS student trying to make a career change to SWE/SysAdmin/Cloud Engineer/Infrastructure Engineer/SRE/[input any other buzzword name here]

The purpose of this repo is to:
* document my learnings about DevOps best practices from a student's perspective
* provide a space to rant about how many tools/how much knowledge is required for an entry level job 
* pass along insight to fellow college students who are interested in a mix of sys admin and programming
